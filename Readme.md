This project allows creating decent frontend by only making java calls to render Bootstrap styled web pages. 

By no mean I claim every bootstrap CSS included in this project, but it contains enough to get you started & a road map of using both your own CSS with Bootstrap CSS in case you want to do more; all these wrapped inside java enums to be used in java renderers.
